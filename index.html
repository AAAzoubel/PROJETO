        <p>Modern gadgets are wonderful. In the old days we were always
            having to pry the burned toast out the toaster. Now the 
            burned toast pops up automatically.
        </p>
        <p>Here we see a toast with a html page, we did this for the exercise of lab 1, classes 
            every week
